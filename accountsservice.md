# D-Bus Accounts Service

The D-Bus suite contains an account manager service to assist new users of
Linux with user control and handling. Since Linux already has a number of
built-in GNU utils to deal with this, it is not actually necessary. It can
be safely removed like so:

```
sudo pacman -R accountsservice
```
